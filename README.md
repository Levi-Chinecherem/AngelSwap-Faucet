# AngelSwap Faucet System

This is the faucet system for **AngelSwap**, a decentralized platform built on **PulseChain**. The faucet allows users to claim tokens daily after connecting their wallets. This system includes features like token claiming, wallet connection, and network guidance for users.

## Features
- **Daily Token Claims**: Users can claim multiple tokens (ANGEL, NGN Token, EKE, ONU, HALO) daily.
- **MetaMask Integration**: Wallet connection with automatic switching to PulseChain network.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile use, accessible via a Telegram mini-app.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple UI to select tokens and view contract addresses for adding to MetaMask.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 16.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node package manager, comes with Node.js)
- [Telegram WebApp](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps) (For Telegram bot functionality)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Levi-Chinecherem/AngelSwap-Faucet.git
   cd AngelSwap-Faucet
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add your contract address for PulseChain network:
   ```
   REACT_APP_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x123ABC456DEF7890
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the app at `http://localhost:3000`. You can now view the faucet system in your browser.

## Usage

### Wallet Connection
- The faucet allows users to connect their MetaMask wallet or any Ethereum-compatible wallet.
- Upon successful wallet connection, the userâ€™s Telegram username will be automatically displayed in the app.

### Claim Tokens
- Users can select from a list of available tokens (ANGEL, NGN Token, EKE, ONU, HALO).
- Each user can claim tokens once per day.
- The faucet displays the contract addresses for each token, which can be added to MetaMask by copying the contract address.

### MetaMask Network Switch Guide
- The system provides guidance for users on how to switch to the **PulseChain** network in MetaMask.
- Contract addresses for the tokens are displayed, and users can easily copy and add them to their wallets.

## File Structure

- `src/` - Contains all the source code for the frontend.
  - `components/` - Contains React components like `Navbar`, `Claim`, `Contract`, `Guide`, `Footer`.
  - `App.js` - Main entry point for the React app.
  - `contract/` - Folder to store contract ABI and related files (optional).
- `.env` - Environment file to store sensitive information like contract address.

## Customizing the Faucet

### Changing Token Details
To change the tokens available in the faucet or their contract addresses, you can modify the `faucetTokens` array in the `App.js` file.

```javascript
const faucetTokens = [
  { name: "ANGEL", contract: "0x123ABC456DEF7890" },
  { name: "NGN Token", contract: "0x456DEF7890ABC123" },
  { name: "EKE", contract: "0x7890ABC123DEF456" },
  { name: "ONU", contract: "0xDEF4567890ABC123" },
  { name: "HALO", contract: "0xABC123DEF4567890" },
];
```

### Modifying the UI
The UI is built with **Tailwind CSS**. You can customize the styling by modifying the classes in the components located in the `src/components/` directory.

For example, to change the background color of the "Claim Tokens" button, you can update the classes in the `Claim.js` file:
```javascript
<button
  onClick={() => claimTokens(selectedToken)}
  disabled={!walletConnected}
  className={`w-full bg-sciFiAccent text-sciFiBg py-3 rounded font-bold ${walletConnected ? "hover:bg-white hover:text-sciFiAccent" : "opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed"} transition`}
>
  Claim Tokens
</button>
```

## Deployment

To deploy the application to production:

1. Build the app:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the `build/` folder to your preferred hosting platform (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, or your custom server).
